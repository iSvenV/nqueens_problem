## Overview 

The N-Queens problem is the challenge of placing **N queens** on an **NÃ—N chessboard** so that no two queens threaten each other.  
This means no two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal.  

This project provides a solution using a **backtracking algorithm** and **genetic algorithm** with an intreactive chessboard.
